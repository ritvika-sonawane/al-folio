I'm a first-year Masters' student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) with a concentration in AI/ML Systems. I'm working in the [LIONS research group](https://research.ece.cmu.edu/lions/) led by [Dr. Carlee Joe-Wong](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cjoewong/). My research interest broadly lies in efficient machine learning and federated learning. 

I completed my B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [NIT Andhra Pradesh](https://nitandhra.ac.in/main/), India, where I worked on several hands-on projects with a focus on deep learning and reinforcement learning to explore the field of AI. Prior to joining CMU, I worked as a Systems Engineer in Research at [Tata Consultancy Services - Research](https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/research) where I spearheaded the design and optimization of various novel ultra wideband antennas and modeled ML solutions to enhance the usability of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces with novel unit cell designs.
